- after inspecting the webpage, we find this javascript file `/my-secret-vault-of-scripts-n-files/ai-script.js`. Nothing is interesting within the file, but it checks the user-agent and checks for the string 'Mac'
- from the description, the os of the server is "Mac OS", generally there is the file `.DS_Store` in every folder, let's check `/.DS_Store`, Nothing in there, but we have found another folder which is `/my-secret-vault-of-scripts-n-files`

Now `/my-secret-vault-of-scripts-n-files/.DS_Store` works!!!!
 - after downloading the file and parse it, we find other filename within the app, and which contains the flag: `the-birth-date-of-my-beloved-apple-tree.txt`
